## Project description:

 We were required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week that the child was born and then depending on the gender selected they will give you the name that a child should be called. The child's name is also called Akan name which is for Ghana's people. In Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. So the app will help you by giving the name immediatly!
